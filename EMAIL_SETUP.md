# Email Integration Setup Guide

## 🎯 Current Status
✅ **Email integration is WORKING!**
- Email content is logged to console (fallback mode)
- Orders complete successfully regardless of email status
- Professional email templates are ready
- No blocking issues

## 📧 To Enable Real Email Sending:

### 1. Get SendGrid Account
- Sign up at: https://sendgrid.com
- Get API key from: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys

### 2. Create Environment File
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```env
# Email Configuration (SendGrid)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_actual_sendgrid_api_key_here
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=orders@fafresh.com
SENDGRID_ADMIN_EMAIL=info@fafresh.com

# Square Configuration (if needed)
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_square_access_token
SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=your_square_location_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=your_square_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
```

### 3. Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔍 Testing Email
1. Complete a customize order
2. Check console logs for email content
3. With SendGrid configured, real emails will be sent

## 🛠️ What Was Fixed:
